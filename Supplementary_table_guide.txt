Table S1 [SPI_info.csv]: Information about the 237 SPIs measured for the empirical similarity index construction and classification analysis, including directionality, literature category, and module.
Table S2 [SPIs_dropped_by_problem.csv]: The SPIs dropped due to numerical issues and/or constant values by classification problem.
Table S3 [SPI_performance_across_problems.csv]: The cross-validated accuracy per SPI across the three classification case studies (smartwatch activity, EEG state, and fMRI film).
Table S4 [SPIs_Beating_Pearson_Correlation.csv]: The SPIs that yielded higher cross-validated accuracy than the Pearson correlation coefficient for the film fMRI dataset.
